## Data

The data analyses in our experiments come from two main sources:
1. The [Natural Scenes Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00962-x), providing fMRI responses and behavioural judgments over multiple images;
2. The [MS COCO dataset](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48), introducing the images used as stimuli in the NSD experiments and crowdsourced image captions. 

The *fMRI responses* used in our study can be downloaded by running the file `src/fmri_responses/download_brain_data.py`.

The *behavioural similarity judgments* can be downloaded [here](https://natural-scenes-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/nsddata/bdata/meadows/Meadows_nsd-multiple-arrangements_v_v2_tree.json).

The image stimuli shown to the participants in the NSD experiments are publicly available [here](https://natural-scenes-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/nsddata/stimuli/nsd/shared1000/).

It is also useful to download [this file](https://natural-scenes-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/nsddata/experiments/nsd/nsd_expdesign.mat), allowing to map between NSD and MS COCO indexing conventions. 

Instructions on how to download the MS COCO captions are provided in [TODO].

## Setup

To be able to run the code included in this repo, please structure your environment using the following commands:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Reproducing Results

The main results from our paper can be reproduced by running the files contained in `job-scripts`. These scripts take care of the following steps:
1. Obtaining machine-generated image captions by running the code contained in `src/caption_generation`;
2. Embedding machine-generated and human-annotated image captions with different language models and computing image features using multiple vision models, running the code provided in `src/representation_extraction`;
3. Computing brain encoding results by running the scripts contained in `src/brain_encoding`;
4. Computing results from representational similarity analysis (RSA) on both neural and behavioural data (similarity judgments), using the code provided in `src/rsa`.

Additional code to analyse these results is provided in `data_analyses`. More specifically, the notebooks included there allow:
* Computing metrics (perplexity, lexical density, visualness) on different caption types; 
* Visualising brain encoding results;
* Visualising neural and behavioural RSA results;
* Fitting mixed-effects models to brain encoding, neural RSA, and behavioural RSA results.

To facilitate the reproduction of plots and statistical analyses, we include a subset of our main results in `results`.
